Activities from class on Thursday, 4/5 and Saturday, 4/7

Summary 4/5: we covered constructors in activities 1-4. Constructors are like the guidelines for how an object will be made, specifying properties and methods. Calling the constructor function with the keyword new instantiates and returns the new object. The activities were straightforward and reinforced building constructors, adding properties and methods to existing objects and methods, and adding properties to a constructor through the constructor function. 

Summary 4/7: we covered the object prototypes and learned that all objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype. We learned about using the prototype property to add new properties and methods to existing constructors. We also learned about recursion — using a function to call itself in order to loop through itself. 
Activities 5-7 were pretty straightforward, but I struggled through 8. I wasn’t quite sure what a lot of the instructions meant or what the end goal was until we went through the activity, so I overcomplicated everything initially. I kept trying to use prototypes and recursive functions since that’s what we had spent the first half of class discussing… eventually it made sense.
